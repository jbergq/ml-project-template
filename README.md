# ml-project-template

Template repo meant to be used as a boilerplate for new machine learning projects.

## Setup conda environment

Create a conda virtual environment as specified in the `req/environment.yaml` file.

> Note: It is recommended to use the [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) package manager instead of conda.
> After installing mamba, simply substitute `conda` with `mamba` in all commands.

```
conda env create -f req/environment.yaml
```
